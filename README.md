WSN Demoboard for Energy Harvesting
===================================

This project aims to develop a demonstration board for integration into a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) using energy harvesting. The board is optimized in terms of hardware and software to ensure low power consumption, enabling it to be powered through Energy Harvesting. The project is focused on exploring the potential of piezoelectric, solar, and thermoelectric sources for energy harvesting.

Getting Started
---------------

To get started with this project, you will need to have the following hardware and software:

### Hardware

* The demoboard itself
* Piezoelectric, solar, and/or thermoelectric sources (depending on your application)

### Software

* Arduino IDE
* Libraries for the specific sensors used in your project

Installation
------------

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.  Open the project in Arduino IDE.
3.  Install the required libraries.
4.  Compile and upload the sketch to the demoboard.

Usage
-----

Connect the energy harvesting sources to the demoboard and power it up. The board will automatically begin to harvest energy and power the sensors. Use the specific libraries for your sensors to collect data and transmit it to the WSN.
